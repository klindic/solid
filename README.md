# Developer Landing Page

This repository provides a small Angular application based on the Paper Kit 2 theme.  
All of the original example components were removed and replaced with a single
page advertising a developer.

## Getting started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser to view the page. Edit
`src/app/app.component.html` to customise the text and links.
